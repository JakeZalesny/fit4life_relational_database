# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

I'm trying to learn how to better work with Databases so that I can efficiently use them in any manner that I need in the future, especially if I need to store files and other personal items.

I wrote a fitness program that runs off of a relational database. It's supposed to write your daily splits for you and you're supposed to be able to use this on a daily basis.

# Relational Database

I have a table set up for every muscle group and I added the ability to make new tables if the user wants to add more muscle groups

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with Python 3.10 and the sqlite3
